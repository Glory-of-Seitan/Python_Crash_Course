Ideas for Programs

    1. Automate my Logseq and Obsidian notes
        A. upon closing program
            1. git add
            2. git commit
            3. git push
        B. upon opening program
            1. git pull

    2. A web application that takes you to a random D&D monster
        A. could be given a CR range
        B. could roll a d20 to determine how helpful/cursed said
           monster
    
    3. A web application that takes you to random interesting facts
       or places or podcasts or information. Like atlas obscura type
       stuff. Chance for cursed items. No overdone memes. 

    4. Make that D&D-styled RPG using public assets (or Radish art?)
       with your own story/writing. Unreal engine?
