In Python you can make lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets, etc store complicated
information and then manipulate that information faster than a million chimpanzees
in a library all acting in perfect unison.

In Python you can have a loop that iterates over every object in a set of data
and it can happen in seconds.

In Python you automate complex interactions of data and variables. You can put
everything into a function and save it to be used later throughout your
programs.

In Python you can define real-world objects or complicated ideas using classes.
You can make subclasses based off of those classes and then instantiate as
many objects of the class as you want without having to rewrite much of the
code. This can save you a lot of time if done efficiently.
